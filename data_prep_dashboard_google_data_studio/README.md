# How to use it?
This dashboard has been structured in sections (from 1 to 6) to facilitate the user experience:
* Sections 1, 2 and 3: **city overview**
    * This section will give you a broad view about the selected city.
    * The idea is to start looking on the big picture before diving on specific census
    * It shows the set of years when any type of census has been done on that city.
    * It also highligh some information about the latest census
* Sextions 4 and 5: **population growth census over census**
    * This section will give you a detailed view about the population change census over census
    * Comparisons on this view will always match census type (region + city type + record type) 
    * You will see the population size year over year as well as the increase/decrease movement according to the prior census 
* Sections 6: **specific census metrics**
    * This is the most granular view and it aims to present metrics about specific census.
    * You must select one row from the table to see metrics broken by gender

# Population change metric
All over this dashboard, you will find a metric named "population change". It shows the increase or decrease movement of the population according to the prior census.

In order to make fair comparisons, this metric will always compare census from the same city + city type + census type

# Dashboard footer
In the end of this dashboard, users might want to take advantage of some specific filters to identify:
* Huge population changes
* Biggest and smallest cities

Note: you should use these features only to identify specific census that match those requirements. Once you have the city name, you should come back to section 1 and start your analysis
